# My personal portfolio website created with Next.js and TailwindCSS

[live demo](https://szymonprusak.vercel.app/)

To create animations I've used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/developers/) and [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer).

This page is fully static. To manage data I've chosen [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), which is a headless CMS. To make this site easy to customize, it uses webhooks that allow me to re-build this site automatically every time I publish something new to Contentful.

Technologies used in this project: 
- Next.js,
- Contentful,
- Framer Motion,
- TailwindCSS,
- react-intersection-observer,
- react-hook-form,
- nodemailer,
